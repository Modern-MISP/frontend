# Einleitung

Stuff I gotta write about (TODO):

- General cypress setup
- Automated CI e2e testing (if this ever ends up working)
- Fixed workflow reactivity (now gets properly invalidated and reset on cancel): https://gitlab.kit.edu/kit/kit-cert/mmisp/frontend/-/merge_requests/141
- List test cases from pflichtenheft and how we tested them
- Additional e2e tests we implemented
- Maybe talk more about unit tests and stuff
